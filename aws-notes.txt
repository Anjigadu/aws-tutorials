4. Existing Libraries


MyISAM (non transaction db)
---------------------------
steps to creating a read replica:
1. stop all DDL and DML operations on non transactional tables and wait for them to complete. SELECT statement can continue running
2. Flush and lock those tables
3. Create read replica using CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API
4. Check progress of replication using DescribeDBInstance API
5. Once replica is available unlock tables and resume normal database operations

CloudFront - Alternate Domain Names:
-------------------------------------
/images/image.jpg > http://www.mydomain.com/images/image.jpg
instead of http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg

1. add CNAME for www.mydomain.com to your distribution
2.update or cretae CNAME record with your DNS service to route queries


Elasticity:
----------
3 ways of implementing:
1. Proactive cycle scaling - periodic scaling that occurs at fixed intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
2. Proactive event based scaling - scaling based on event like a big surge of traffic requests due to a scheduled business event (new product launc, marketing campaigns, etc.)
3. Auto-scaling based on demand: by using a monitoring service, your system can send triggers to take appropriate actions, scale up or down based on metrics (utilization of servers, network I/O)


Instance stores:
-------------------
Data on instance stores persists only during life of the instance
If an instance reboots then data persists

Data is lost under following scenarios:
- Failure of an underlying drive
- Stopping and Amazon EBS backed instance
- Terminating an instance

Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for long term data 
instead keep replication strategy across multiple instances, storing data on S3 or using EBS volumes
