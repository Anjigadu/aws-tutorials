---------------------------
steps to creating a read replica:
1. stop all DDL and DML operations on non transactional tables and wait for them to complete. SELECT statement can continue running
2. Flush and lock those tables
3. Create read replica using CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API
4. Check progress of replication using DescribeDBInstance API
5. Once replica is available unlock tables and resume normal database operations
